                        Who is a front-end developer?
                    </p>
                    <p class="intro">
                        A front-end developer is someone who focuses on creating
                        the part of a website or web application that users interact with directly.
                        This includes everything that users experience visually—like the layout, design, navigation, and
                        interactivity.
                        Frontend developers use languages like HTML (for structure), CSS (for styling), and JavaScript
                        (for interactivity). They may also work with frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or
                        Vue.js to make the development process more efficient and dynamic.

                        If you're visiting a website and interacting with elements like buttons, forms, or animations, a
                        frontend developer likely worked on creating those features.

                        Why I Want to Be a Front-End Developer
                    </p>
                    <p class="intro">
                        I want to become a frontend developer because I have a deep passion for both creativity and
                        problem-solving,
                        and frontend development perfectly blends these two aspects. The ability to shape the user
                        experience through design,
                        code, and interaction excites me. I’m drawn to the idea of building websites and applications
                        that are not only functional but also engaging and visually appealing.
                        Creating interfaces that people interact with every day feels incredibly rewarding,
                        as it allows me to have a direct impact on how users experience digital products.
